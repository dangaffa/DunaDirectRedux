Changelog:

1.10.1

Recompile for KSP 1.10.1
All engines mass / thrust balanced (Thanks JadeOfMaar)
Fixed Small-scale Agency logo not loading

1.8.1 / New Unity

General:
Update and move all parts from Blender 2.7 .blend to Blender 2.8 .fbx 
Import new .fbx files and re-compile all parts for new Unity and KSP 1.8.1
All parts that were using "mesh =" now using "model ="
Adjusted base Tweakscale values
Eliminated B9+Cryotanks+CommunityResourcePack+DunaDirect incompatibility by doing the following:
- Added two resource definitions for DDCarbonDioxide and DDLqdHydrogen
- Mimicked Community Resource Pack definitions for Carbon Dioxide and Liquid Hydrogen
- ISRU now references DDCarbonDioxide and DDLqdHydrogen
- Community Resource Pack no longer required for ISRU functionality

Stage 1:
Patch to add 9x inventory space if Breaking Ground expansion is present
Deepened the hole for Stage 2
Fixed scaling issue with Stage 1 Engines (Thanks JadeOfMaar)
Combined the 3x light modules on Stage 1 into 1x light module
Lowered default starting fuel for Stage 1 (create more using ISRU after landing)
Lowered fuel amounts

Stage 1 Engines:
Lowered thrust values - engines
Increased fuel + oxidizer intake ratios
Engines now use ModuleEnginesFX
Stock and Real Plume FX now move with engine gimbals

Stage 2 Engines:
Lowered thrust values
Increased fuel + oxidizer intake ratios
Lowered max temp
Removed fairing jettison module as there is no fairing to jettison
Engines now user ModuleEnginesFX
Stock and Real Plume FX now move with engine gimbals

Stage 2:

- Original texture
- Original texture-styled deep-space version
- New re-textured, original-style
- New re-textured, original-style, deep-space version
Added RTG decay when Near Future Electrical is installed (Thanks Gordon Dry)
Adjusted center of mass / lift (Thanks Jso)
Updated Kerbalism configs including science experiments takeover (Thanks Sir Mortimer)
Replaced science experiments with custom experiments
Lowered fuel amounts

Docking Port:
Renamed toggle name to Toggle Nosecone from Toggle Transform (Thanks Mecripp)
Lowered ablator values

1.8 Update Mew Parts:
Weaver Habitat - Habitat for planetary surface operations. Science lab, cargo bay, spotlights, IVA, RTG, science experiments, side ladder colliders, RTG.
Tharsis Boots - Landing legs for the habitat unit. On placement, habitat is bi-symmetrical and not 4x.
Boreum Sandbags - Sandbags for radiation protection. (Radiation only present with Kerbalism mod - Thanks Sir Mortimer)
Schiaparelli Steps - Deployable ramp and ladder for getting to and from the habitat's airlock from the ground.
Hellas Engines - The retro-firing engines for landing of the habitat unit
Arrakis Interface Antenna - Antenna for the habitat unit to provide communications functions
Olympus Mons Heatshield - Heatshield for the habitat unit. Similar to the Svalin heatshield, but with less space constraints.
Gale RCS Thrusters - RCS thrusters for the habitat unit.
Samara Nosecone - The original nosecone for the Kerbin Return Vehicle, without a docking port or opening lid, but still containing parachutes.

Parts List:
Zubrin Command Pod - Kerbin return vehicle. 20x built-in RCS ports, science lab, science experiments, SAS module, IVA, RTG, lights.
Baker 1st Stage - The large first stage houses a cargo bay and four inset landing legs. Contains bay light and exterior spotlights.
Rudaux Nosecone - Animated nosecone opens to reveal docking port and parachutes. Has ablative shielding for atmospheric entry or re-entry protection.
Marietta Engines - A pair of these engines power the Kerbin Return Vehicle. Very high efficiency. Animated gimbals and emissives.
MIRA LM-20 Engines - Four sets of four advanced MIRA engines power the landing and ascent of the Duna Direct vehicle. Animated gimbals and emissives.
Acidalia Huggers - These collapsible landing legs are a staple design element of the vehicle.
Svalinn Heatshield - Expanding heatshield designed for atmospheric entry and aerobraking. Contains solar panels for extra power generation in flight. Contains
