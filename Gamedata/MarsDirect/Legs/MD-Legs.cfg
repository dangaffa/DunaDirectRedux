    description = Duna Direct's landing legs, designed for attachment on the Baker 1st stage. The cadillac of suspension legs. "It feels like you're landing on a cloud." The odd implementation suggests they were an afterthought in the design process. Feel free to adjust the values in the VAB before launch.
